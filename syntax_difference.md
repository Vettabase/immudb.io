# SQL syntax differences between immudb and PostgreSQL  

In this section, we discuss the following differences between immudb and PostgreSQL when creating tables via SQL. 

-  SQL syntax that works in both immudb and PostgreSQL.
-  SQL syntax that works in PostgreSQL but not in immudb.
-  Type of indexes supported in both PostgreSQL and immudb.
-  Type of PostgreSQL indexes not supported in immudb.    

##  Differences between immudb and PostgreSQL when creating tables via SQL

The following shows subtle differences between immudb and PostgreSQL:
 
### Double Quotes

In immudb, the `CREATE TABLE` command needs to be placed in between two double quotes as shown by the following command.

The command below creates a table with two columns: `name` and `location`. Data types include `INTEGER` type and `VARCHAR` type.

```
immuclient exec ""CREATE TABLE post_table ( name VARCHAR(60) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, location VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE);"
```


In PostgreSQL, the `CREATE` COMMAND can't execute successfully if placed between two double quotes as shown by the error message below. 

```
"CREATE TABLE post_table ( name VARCHAR(60) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, location VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE);"
```

```
"create table put_syntax ( name VARCHAR(60) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, location VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE);"
```

As shown by the `\dt` meta-command in PostgreSQL, the tables `post_table` and `put_syntax` are not present in the list of relations because the operation is not supported by PostgreSQL.

```
            List of relations
 Schema |    Name     | Type  |  Owner   
--------+-------------+-------+----------
 public | post_syntax | table | postgres
 public | uab_syntax  | table | postgres
(2 rows) 

```

Finally both immudb and PostgreSQL allows you to define the `IF EXISTS` option differently.   
PostgreSQL `IF EXISTS` option is placed between square brackets as shown below

```
CREATE TABLE [IF NOT EXISTS] post_table (name VARCHAR(60), location VARCHAR(56) );  
```

Whilst immudb does allow the `IF EXISTS` option to standalone without the square brackets.  

```
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS post_table (name VARCHAR(60), location VARCHAR(56) );
```

### Command Sensitivity

It is not possible to execute the `CREATE TABLE` command alternatively as `create table` command in immudb. It is not yet allowed. However, Postgresql supports both `CREATE TABLE` or `create table` commands.

## SQL syntax compatible with immudb and PostgreSQL

The following syntax is compatible with immudb and PostgreSQL as well:    
**NB**: immudb however expects you to embed SQL commands in between double-quotes and prepend it with the `exec` command.

### Inserting values into a table  

```
INSERT INTO post_table (name, location)
    VALUES ('Dave’, ‘Accra’);  
```
```
SELECT name, location FROM people WHERE name='Dave'
```
```
SELECT id, name, salary FROM post_table
```

## SQL syntax compatible with PostgreSQL only

The following SQL syntax is not yet supported by immudb:   

```
UPDATE post_table SET name = 'Gave' WHERE name = 'Dave';
```
```
DELETE FROM post_table WHERE name = 'Jane’;
```
```
DROP TABLE post_table;   
```
```
ALTER TABLE post_table ADD COLUMN city varchar(30);
```
```
ALTER TABLE post_table DROP COLUMN location; 
```

>**NB**:  immudb does not yet support **ALTER**, **DROP** and **DELETE** commands. However
you can update values as well as insert tables using the **UPSERT** command in immudb.  
``` 
CREATE TABLE post_table ( name VARCHAR(60) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, location VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE);
```
```
create table post_table ( name VARCHAR(60) PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, location VARCHAR(40) NOT NULL UNIQUE);
```
